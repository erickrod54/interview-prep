            <h3>Handling an offer:</h3>

            <p>
                Make an agreement on why i am the right fit on the team, by this point the conversation 
                keep going for both parties in the same page, in a positive mood, there are some tips to
                handle this answer: 

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don't end the conversation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be positive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ask for time
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Let other companies know ( for the case of multiple offers or frelancer contracts )
                    </li>
                </ul>

                and key to keep in mind is to let them know that i will produce <strong> big value </strong>
                to the company ( because this builds social probe ), there is a todo list that must be made
                previous to this process as:

                <ul>
                    <li>Find the exact salary that i want ( get the average salary or above it )</li>
                    <li>What value i am going to provide to the company ( create a value for the company )</li>
                    <li>If you have a goog <strong> value </strong> for the company i can ask more and go higher </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Handling multiple offers:</h3>

            <h3>Handling a rejection:</h3>

            <p>
                sometimes the greatest people of the tech get rejected ( this does not mean anything )
                as dating, that does mean maybe was not the right fit at the moment, but 99 rejections
                and 1 good offer is worth, cause the feedback of 99 rejections make me have that good
                offer ( many of those examples at google )
            </p>

            <h3>Getting a raise:</h3>

            <h3>Negotiation 101:</h3>

            <p>
                there is a lot of cultures and standards to make a negotiation, and multiple questions surge:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What salary you desired ? ( R: the average software get around xxxxxx, we can start at that number )
                    </li>
                </ul>

                and support this answer with some reasons to support the negotiation of this number, maybe involving a 
                thirdparty as family or parthner in the decision making, so will be a way to support also the negiotiation 
                process

                <strong> cultures </strong> plays a big role in this process, there is some tips that can be include
                in this process:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Don't end the conversation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Give reason for everything
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Always negotiate
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be positive
                    </li>
                </ul>

                It is always good to have <strong> steakes </strong> as other options as <strong> multiple offers </strong>, or as 
                my <strong> freelance job </strong>, and always work with recruiters to make changes fast and complete the offer 
            </p>
